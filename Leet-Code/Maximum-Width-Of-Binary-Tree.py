# Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree.
# The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure
# as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.
#
# The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes
# (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level,
#  where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
#
#            1
#          /   \
#         3     2
#        / \     \
#       5   3     9
#
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
# Example 2:
# Input:
#
#           1
#          /
#         3
#        / \
#       5   3
#
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
# Example 3:
# Input:
#
#           1
#          / \
#         3   2
#        /
#       5
#
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
# Example 4:
# Input:
#
#           1
#          / \
#         3   2
#        /     \
#       5       9
#      /         \
#     6           7
# Output: 8
# Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
#
# Note: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
