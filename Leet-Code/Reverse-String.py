# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

# You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
# Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

# Example 2:

# Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
# Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
